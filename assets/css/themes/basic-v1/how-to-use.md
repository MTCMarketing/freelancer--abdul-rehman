## **Custom Spacing Classes**

These classes are used to control the spacing (margins and paddings) of elements on different screen sizes (desktop and mobile). They utilize the predefined CSS variables for consistent spacing across the site.

### **Classes:**

- **`.mt-lg`**: Adds a large margin to the top of an element for desktop screens.
- **`.mt-sm`**: Adds a small margin to the top of an element for mobile screens.
- **`.mb-lg`**: Adds a large margin to the bottom of an element for desktop screens.
- **`.mb-sm`**: Adds a small margin to the bottom of an element for mobile screens.
- **`.pt-lg`**: Adds a large padding to the top of an element for desktop screens.
- **`.pt-sm`**: Adds a small padding to the top of an element for mobile screens.
- **`.pb-lg`**: Adds a large padding to the bottom of an element for desktop screens.
- **`.pb-sm`**: Adds a small padding to the bottom of an element for mobile screens.

### **Example Usage:**

```html
<div class="mt-lg">Content with large top margin (desktop)</div>
<div class="mt-sm">Content with small top margin (mobile)</div>
